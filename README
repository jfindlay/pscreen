install:
  python setup.py install --prefix=~/.local
  pscreen edit-profiles
  # interact with screen as you normally would

uninstall:
  python setup.py install --prefix=~/.local --record inst
  rm -v $(<inst) inst

Currently, pscreen cannot create screen sessions from within other sessions.  First detach nesting session to create a new session and then reattach as needed.
